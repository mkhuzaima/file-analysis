Problem: File	Analysis (Advanced)
Description: You	are	given	a	directory	containing	a	large	number	of	text	files.	Your	task	is	to	create	a
Python	program	that	performs	advanced	file	analysis	on	these	text	files	and	generates	a	report
summarizing	various	statscs	and	insights.
Specifications:
1. The	program	should	accept	the	following	command-line	arguments:
• -d	or	--directory:	The	path	to	the	directory	containing	the	text	files	for	analysis.
• -o	or	--output:	The	path	to	the	output	report	file.
2. Perform	the	following	analyses	on	each	text	file	in	the	directory:
• Count	the	number	of	lines	in	each	file.
• Count	the	number	of	words	in	each	file.
• Iden%fy	the	top	N	most	common	words	(excluding	common	stop	words	like	"the,"	"and,"
"in,"	etc.)	in	each	file.
• Determine	the	average	word	length	in	each	file.
• Calculate	the	ra+o	of	vowels	to	consonants	in	each	file.
3. Generate	a	comprehensive	report	that	includes:
• A	summary	of	the	total	number	of	files	analyzed.
• For	each	file,	list	the	file	name,	number	of	lines,	number	of	words,	top N	words,	average
word	length,	and	vowel-to-consonant	ra)o.
4. The	report	should	be	wri0en	to	the	output	file	in	a	structured	format,	such	as	CSV	or	JSON,
for	easy	analysis.
5. Implement	error	handling	to	check	for	valid	directory	paths	and	handle	excep7ons
accordingly.
6. Ensure	that	the	program	is	well	documented,	with	comments	explaining	the	code's
functionality.
